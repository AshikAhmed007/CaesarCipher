# Caesar Cipher Tool (Python)

This is a simple Python-based Caesar Cipher tool that allows you to **encrypt** and **decrypt** text messages using a shift-based substitution cipher. It's a great demonstration of one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques in cryptography.

- ‚úÖ Decrypt previously encrypted messages  
- ‚úÖ Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters  
- ‚úÖ Keeps non-alphabetic characters (like spaces, punctuation) unchanged  
- ‚úÖ Handles both positive and negative shift values

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher-tool.git
cd caesar-cipher-tool
```

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```

### 3. Follow the Prompts

#### Example: Encryption

```
=== Caesar Cipher ===
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? E
Enter your message: Hello World!
Enter shift value (integer): 3
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog!
```

#### Example: Decryption

```
=== Caesar Cipher ===
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? D
Enter your message: Khoor Zruog!
Enter shift value (integer): 3
Decrypted message: Hello World!
```
